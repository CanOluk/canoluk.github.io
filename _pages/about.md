I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Laboratory of Psychophysics ([LPSY](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpsy/)) at EPFL. You can reach me at [cnoluk@gmail.com](mailto:cnoluk@gmail.com). Here is my [CV](http://canoluk.github.io/files/CV_CanOluk.pdf); for more, see [about me](https://canoluk.github.io/about_me/).

I am interested in human behaviour and its underlying neural mechanisms. Despite enormous interest in explaining how we solve complex tasks, display striking flexibility, and adapt fluidly to change, understanding behaviour remains one of scienceâ€™s toughest challenges. Because many of these capacities rely on the effective use of visual signals, which provide rich, detailed information about the physical world, I primarily study vision.

To uncover principles of visual processing, I build image computable models to explain how the human visual system extracts information from the physical world to guide action across tasks such as slant perception, motion direction estimation, and target detection ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NwCzTz8AAAAJ&hl=tr&oi=ao), [models](https://github.com/CanOluk)). In particular, I extend principled, interpretable models (e.g., Bayesian ideal observers) to relatively complex tasks and test their generalisability across task variations. I am also interested in model selection theory; see my [Research](https://canoluk.github.io/research/).

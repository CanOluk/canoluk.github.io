I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Laboratory of Psychophysics ([LPSY](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpsy/)) at EPFL. You can reach me at [cnoluk@gmail.com](mailto:cnoluk@gmail.com). Here is my [CV](http://canoluk.github.io/files/CV_CanOluk.pdf).

<span style="font-size: 93%;"> My research focuses on building image-computable models to explain how the human visual system extracts information from the physical world to guide action across broad range of tasks. In particular, I extend principled, interpretable models (e.g., Bayesian ideal observers) to relatively complex tasks and test their generalisability across task variations. Beyond visual perception, I am interested in theory of model selection and broadly interested in human behaviour and its underlying neural mechanisms (e.g., confidence and consciousness).</span>

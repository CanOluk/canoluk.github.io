I am working in the Laboratory of Psychophysics ([LPSY](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpsy/)) at EPFL as a postdoctoral researcher, working with Prof. Michael Herzog. Currently, I am also collaborating with Prof. Pascal Mamassian, associated with Laboratoire des systèmes perceptifs ([LSP](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en)) at the École Normale Supérieure, PSL University and collaborating with Prof. Wilson Geisler, associated with the [Center for Perceptual Systems](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/cps/) at the University of Texas at Austin.

I am interested in understanding how the human visual system processes images to construct a representation of the world around us, enabling us to succeed in many natural tasks. My research primarily involves developing image-computable computational and statistical models of visual processing, with an emphasis on deriving and implementing Bayesian ideal observers for a broad spectrum of visual tasks such as slant, motion estimation, and pattern detection ([scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NwCzTz8AAAAJ&hl=tr&oi=ao), [some example models](https://github.com/CanOluk)) to understand the experimental measurements. For further details about my research interests, see [Research](https://canoluk.github.io/research/).

Here is my [CV](http://canoluk.github.io/files/CV_CanOluk.pdf). You can reach me via email (cnoluk@gmail.com) and find more information about me from [here](https://canoluk.github.io/about_me/).

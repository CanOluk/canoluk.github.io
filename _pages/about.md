I am working in the Laboratory of Psychophysics ([LPSY](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpsy/)) at EPFL as a postdoctoral researcher.

I build image-computable models to explain how the human visual system extracts information from the physical world to guide action across tasks such as slant perception, motion-direction estimation, and target detection ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NwCzTz8AAAAJ&hl=tr&oi=ao), [models](https://github.com/CanOluk)). Specifically, I extend principled, interpretable models (e.g., Bayesian ideal observers) to relatively complex tasks and test their generalizability across task variations. I am also interested in theory of model selection; see my [Research](https://canoluk.github.io/research/).

Here is my [CV](http://canoluk.github.io/files/CV_CanOluk.pdf). You can reach me via email (cnoluk@gmail.com) and find more information about me from [here](https://canoluk.github.io/about_me/).

I am a postdoctoral associate at Laboratoire des systèmes perceptifs ([LSP](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en)), École normale supérieure, PSL University. I am working with Prof.Pascal Mamassian.  I am also still associated with [the Center for Perceptual Systems](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/cps/) at the Univerversity of Texas at Austin, working with Prof. Wilson Geisler.

My previous work mainly focused on the computational models of visual processing for understanding behavioral responses, with an emphasize on the derivation and implementation of Bayesian ideal observers. In the future, I am planning to focus more on the theoretical and computational aspects of visual processing (some of my research interests can be found [here](https://canoluk.github.io/research/)).

Here is my [CV](http://canoluk.github.io/files/CV_CanOluk.pdf). You can reach me via email (cnoluk@gmail.com) and find more information about me from [here](https://canoluk.github.io/about_me/).

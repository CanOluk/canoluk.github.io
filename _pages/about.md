I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Laboratory of Psychophysics ([LPSY](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpsy/)) at EPFL. You can reach me at [cnoluk@gmail.com](mailto:cnoluk@gmail.com). Here is my [CV](http://canoluk.github.io/files/CV_CanOluk.pdf).

<span style="font-size: 90%;"> My research focuses on building image-computable models to explain how the human visual system extracts information from the physical world to guide action across broad range of tasks like as slant perception, motion direction estimation, and target detection. In particular, I extend principled, interpretable models (e.g., Bayesian ideal observers) to relatively complex tasks and test their generalisability across task variations. I am also interested in theory of model selection. Beyond visual perception, I am broadly interested in human behaviour and its underlying neural mechanisms (e.g., confidence and consciousness).</span>

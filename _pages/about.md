I will be joining the Laboratory of Psychophysics ([LPSY](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpsy/)) at EPFL as a postdoctoral researcher, working with Prof. Micheal Herzog. Currently, I am also associated with Laboratoire des systèmes perceptifs ([LSP](https://lsp.dec.ens.fr/en)), École Normale Supérieure, PSL University, working with Prof. Pascal Mamassian and the [Center for Perceptual Systems](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/cps/) at the University of Texas at Austin, working with Prof. Wilson Geisler.

I am interested in understanding the principles of how the human visual system processes images to construct a representation of the world around us that enables us to be extremely successful in many natural tasks. Specifically, my research primarily involves developing image-computable computational and statistical models of visual processing, with an emphasis on deriving and implementing Bayesian ideal observers for a broad spectrum of visual tasks such as slant, motion estimation, and pattern detection ([scholoar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NwCzTz8AAAAJ&hl=tr&oi=ao), [some example models](https://github.com/CanOluk)) to understand the experimental measurements. For further details about my research interests, see [Resesarch](https://canoluk.github.io/research/).

Here is my [CV](http://canoluk.github.io/files/CV_CanOluk.pdf). You can reach me via email (cnoluk@gmail.com) and find more information about me from [here](https://canoluk.github.io/about_me/).

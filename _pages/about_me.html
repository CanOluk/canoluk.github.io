I received my B.A. in Psychology from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) (Turkey) with a minor in Philosophy in 2016. 
Then, I received my Ph.D. degree in Psychology from the University of Texas at Austin in 2022. 
During my Ph.D., I was associated with [the Center for Perceptual Systems](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/cps/) (specifically Geisler lab) and conducted my graduate studies under the supervision of Prof.Wilson Geisler.

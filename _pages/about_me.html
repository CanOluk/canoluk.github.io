I earned my B.A. in Psychology, with a minor in Philosophy, from Bilkent University, Türkiye, in 2016. During my undergraduate studies, I completed substantial coursework in engineering and mathematics and worked for three years at the National Magnetic Resonance Research Center (UMRAM) with Prof. Hulusi Kafaligonul. I then completed my Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin in 2022, specifically following the Center for Perceptual Systems interdisciplinary training program in perception. During my Ph.D., I worked at the Center for Perceptual Systems with Prof. Wilson Geisler. In 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at École Normale Supérieure (PSL) in the Laboratoire des systèmes perceptifs. In 2024, I began a postdoctoral position at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in the Laboratory of Psychophysics.  

I have a wide mix of interests across science and art. I like to read and learn about many fields of science, such as physics, mathematics, philosophy, machine learning, economics, and sociology. I am also interested in classic and modern literature and film. I try to organize my interests around a clear big picture purpose (which generally involves reflection on existence and life). That structure helps me keep my time balanced and feel comfortable with how I spend it. When a topic feels meaningful and I am confident that it is worth the effort, I like to dive in and study it thoroughly, down to the fine details.  

For example, reading novels is a significant part of my life, and I have already read several long classics, such as *In Search of Lost Time*, *Ulysses*, and *The Man Without Qualities*. Among modern authors, some of my favorites are Juli Zeh and Jonathan Safran Foer; among classic authors, Robert Musil and Fernando Pessoa.  

As one might expect, I enjoy casually discussing and thinking about big questions at almost any time, often for hours, and I balance that interest by staying physically active, mostly by playing basketball and hiking with my wife.

I received my B.A. in Psychology from Bilkent University (Turkey) with a minor in Philosophy in 2016. Then, I received my Ph.D. degree in Psychology from the University of Texas at Austin in 2022. 
During my Ph.D., I was associated with the Center for Perceptual Systems (specifically Geisler lab) and conducted my graduate studies under the supervision of Prof.Wilson Geisler.
